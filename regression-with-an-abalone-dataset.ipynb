Abalone Age Prediction Model\n","\n","### Data Overview:\n","- The dataset contains information about abalones, a type of marine mollusk, and their physical measurements.\n","- Features include length, diameter, height, and various weight measurements.\n","- The target variable is the number of rings, which is commonly used as an indicator of the abalone's age.\n","\n","### Data Preprocessing:\n","- **Handling Missing Values**: No missing values were found in the dataset.\n","- **Feature Engineering**: One-hot encoding was performed for the 'Sex' column to convert categorical data into numerical format.\n","- **Feature Scaling**: Features were standardized using StandardScaler to ensure all features have the same scale.\n","\n","### Model Training:\n","- **Splitting Data**: The dataset was split into training and validation sets using a 80-20 split ratio.\n","- **Model Selection**: Linear Regression was chosen as the predictive model due to its simplicity and interpretability.\n","- **Model Training**: The model was trained on the training data after preprocessing.\n","\n","### Model Evaluation:\n","- **RMSLE Metric**: Root Mean Squared Log Error (RMSLE) was used as the evaluation metric to measure the accuracy of the model's predictions on the validation set.\n","- **Clipping Predictions**: Negative predictions were clipped to ensure they are non-negative before calculating RMSLE.\n","\n","### Making Predictions on Test Data:\n","- After training the model and evaluating its performance, predictions were made on the test dataset.\n","- The test dataset underwent the same preprocessing steps as the training dataset to ensure consistency.\n","- Predictions were made using the trained model on the preprocessed test data.\n","- The predicted values were saved in a submission file for further analysis or submission to competitions.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"e8febb1f","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-10T12:13:24.318975Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-10T12:13:24.318614Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-10T12:13:26.08187Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-10T12:13:26.080827Z"},"papermill":{"duration":1.772014,"end_time":"2024-04-10T12:13:26.084423","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-04-10T12:13:24.312409","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["import
