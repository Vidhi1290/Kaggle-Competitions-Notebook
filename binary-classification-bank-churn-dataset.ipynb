The goal is to anticipate whether a customer will continue with their account or close it (churn).\n","\n","## Dataset\n","\n","The dataset includes two CSV files:\n","- `train.csv`: The training dataset with labeled churn information.\n","- `test.csv`: The test dataset for making predictions.\n","\n","## Model Building Process\n","\n","1. **Data Preprocessing:**\n","   - Drop unnecessary columns (`id`, `CustomerId`, `Surname`).\n","   - Split data into features (X) and the target variable (y).\n","   - Perform train-test split for model evaluation.\n","   - Identify numerical and categorical features.\n","\n","2. **Feature Engineering:**\n","   - Create a preprocessing pipeline to handle missing values and scale numerical features.\n","   - Apply one-hot encoding to categorical features.\n","\n","3. **Model Training:**\n","   - Construct a model pipeline using the RandomForestClassifier.\n","   - Train the model on the training set.\n","\n","4. **Model Evaluation:**\n","   - Evaluate the model on the validation set using ROC AUC.\n","\n","5. **Prediction and Submission:**\n","   - Make predictions on the test set.\n","   - Create a submission file adhering to the required format.\n","\n","## Usage\n","\n","1.
